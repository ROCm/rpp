Installing ROCm Performance Primitives
********************************************************************

ROCm Performance Primitives (RPP) supports HIP, OpenCL, and CPU-only backends. The CPU backend is also referred to as the HOST backend.

A :doc:`package installer <./rpp-install-with-installer>` is available for installing either only the RPP runtime, or the RPP runtime and development packages.

RPP can also be :doc:`built from source <./rpp-build-and-install>`.

After installing RPP, :doc:`verify the installation using the test suite <./rpp-verify-install>`.
